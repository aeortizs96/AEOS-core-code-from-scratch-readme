   :boom: Base on this reading and this video, create an explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages in your README
=======
    A compiled programming language is a language that needs to be transcribed from a 
    human language into a machine language;
    It is said that this type of languages were the first to be created.

=======
    Then we have the interpreted programming languages, these languages are famous 
    because they are executed while compiling.
  
    I liked very much to read in the article the information of the Python programming 
    language, because it can be executed as a compiled program or as an interpreted  
    language. 
        
    
| Compiled      | Interpreted | Hybrid |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------- |
| C      | PHP       |Java |
| C++   | JavaScript       |Python |

:boom:**Exercise 2**  The language java is compiled and interpreted

        It is said that the java programming language is compiled and interpreted   
        because as you can see in the image, initially a program is created 
        containing .java files, in this file is written the java language that then 
        goes through the java compiler process that is known as javac, previously this 
        process was done by console, now it is done with a run button, from that 
        moment it is converted to a language that the machine can read, this language 
        is called ByteCode, this file will contain strange characters and symbols, 
        finally it arrives to the JVM and creates the multiplatform effect.
