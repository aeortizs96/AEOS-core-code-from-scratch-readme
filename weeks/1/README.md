:boom:**Exercise 1** Explanation about Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

    A compiled programming language is a language that needs to be transcribed from a human language into a machine language;
    It is said that this type of languages were the first to be created.

    Then we have the interpreted programming languages, these languages are famous because they are executed while compiling.
  
    I liked very much to read in the article the information of the Python programming language, because it can be executed as a compiled program or as an interpreted  
    language.
